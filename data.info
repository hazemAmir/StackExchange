The data directory contains all about data for training and testing alignment approaches. It is roughly divided in two subdirectories that is: corpora and eval.
- the eval directory contains pairs of similar questions (respectively pairs of questions and thei corresponfing answers) for train, dev and test.
- the corpora directory contains a lemmatized and lemmatized plus postaged data sets. Each corpus is represented by a directory that lists the posts of all the questions (earthscience.stackexchange/ for instance ) and a file that contains the aligned pairs with their corresponding Ids (earthscience.csv for instance)
